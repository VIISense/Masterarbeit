Tableau algorithms are important tools for description logic (DL) reasoning and have led to very efficient implementations. The presence of number restrictions [1,2], however, requires further optimizations like the use of dedicated numerical solvers as subroutines [3]. The novel DL ALCSCC [4] generalizes ALCQ by allowing to formulate restrictions on the number and type of role successors using more expressive arithmetical constraints. So far, algorithms for ALCSCC are based on the nondeterministic guessing of types of objects and solving the arithmetical constraints in a black-box fashion using external solvers.

The goal of this thesis is to investigate tableau algorithms for ALCSCC, in particular a better integration of the goal-directed nature of tableau rules [1,2] with the black-box use of a numerical solver for restrictions on role successors [3,4]. The tableau algorithm should be able to call the solver with partial information, and the solver should be able to update its calculations once new information becomes available from the tableau rules. The developed algorithm should be proven to be correct and terminating.

Particular research questions are:

* Which kind of blocking conditions are necessary to guarantee termination of a tableau algorithm for ALCSCC?

* Inhowfar can a numerical solver deal with partial information, induced by a (partial) object type that was constructed by tableau rules? How does this depend on the precise shape of the numerical constraints?

* How much of an impact can the proposed techniques be expected to have in practical scenarios?

* Can the tableau algorithm be extended to deal with nominals and cardinality restrictions [5], as it was done for ALCQ [6,7]?
